# SFS_blueprint_manager
SFS Blueprint manager is a program that makes it easier to work with drawings for Spaceflight Simulator. Here you will find beautiful themes, a mission editor, company systems, a built-in editor with a more user-friendly interface than the one offered by Stef Morojna in his game.
